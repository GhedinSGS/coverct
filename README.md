# coverct
predicts (relative) viral load in a sequencing batch with state of the art performance in a full range Ct values. Through DuckDB SQL-like on-disk processing, it is speedy and memory efficient running within seconds on a batch of samples. It summarizes per-position per-sample features into sample level summary features, which are then fed into a random forest regression (a form of classical machine learning) to interpolate missing Ct values. The model performance is explainable and input features are based on uneveneness of coverage depths across nucleotide positions and number of minor variants (MAF < 0.50) called per sample.
